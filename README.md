### **MSG-GAN**: Multi-Scale Gradient GAN for Stable Image Synthesis

_Abstract:_ <br>
While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have seen huge 
successes in image synthesis tasks, they are notoriously difficult 
to use, in part due to instability during training. One commonly 
accepted reason for this instability is that gradients passing from 
the discriminator to the generator can quickly become uninformative, 
due to a learning imbalance during training. In this work, we propose 
the Multi-Scale Gradient Generative Adversarial Network (MSG-GAN), 
a simple but effective technique for addressing this problem which 
allows the flow of gradients from the discriminator to the generator 
at multiple scales. This technique provides a stable approach for 
generating synchronized multi-scale images. We present a 
very intuitive implementation of the mathematical MSG-GAN 
framework which uses the concatenation operation in the 
discriminator computations. We empirically validate the effect 
of our MSG-GAN approach through experiments on the CIFAR10 and 
Oxford102 flowers datasets and compare it with other relevant 
techniques which perform multi-scale image synthesis. In addition, 
we also provide details of our experiment on CelebA-HQ dataset 
for synthesizing 1024 x 1024 high resolution images.

An explanatory training time-lapse video/gif for the MSG-GAN. The higher resolution layers initially display plain colour blocks but eventually (very soon) the training penetrates all layers and then they all work in unison to produce better samples. Please observe the first few secs of the training, where the face like blobs appear in a sequential order from the lowest resolution to the highest resolution. 

### Multi-Scale Gradients architecture

</p>

<p>
The above figure describes the architecture of MSG-GAN for 
generating synchronized multi-scale images. Our method is 
based on the architecture proposed in proGAN, 
but instead of a progressively growing training scheme, 
includes connections from the intermediate
layers of the generator to the intermediate layers of the 
discriminator. The multi-scale images input to 
the discriminator are converted into spatial 
volumes which are concatenated with the corresponding 
activation volumes obtained from the main path of 
convolutional layers.
</p> <br>

<p>
For the discrimination process, appropriately downsampled 
versions of the real images are fed to corresponding layers 
of the discriminator as shown in the diagram (from above).

Above figure explains how, during training, all the layers 
in the MSG-GAN first synchronize colour-wise and subsequently 
improve the generated images at various scales. 
The brightness of the images across all layers (scales) 
synchronizes eventually

### Running the Code
**Please note to use value of `learning_rate=0.003` for 
both G and D for all experiments for best results**. The model 
is quite robust and converges to a very similar FID or IS 
very quickly even for different learning rate settings.
Please use the `relativistic-hinge` as the loss function 
(set as default) for training.

Start the training by running the `train.py` script in the `sourcecode/` 
directory. Refer to the following parameters for tweaking for your own use:

##### Sample Training Run
For training a network at resolution `256 x 256`, 
use the following arguments:

    $ python train.py --depth=7 \ 
                      --latent_size=512 \
                      --images_dir=<path to images> \
                      --sample_dir=samples/exp_1 \
                      --model_dir=models/exp_1

Set the `batch_size`, `feedback_factor` and 
`checkpoint_factor` accordingly.
We used 2 Tesla V100 GPUs of the 
DGX-1 machine for our experimentation.
